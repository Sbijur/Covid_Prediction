# Covid_Prediction


Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused worldwide health concern since
December 2019. Since the onset of infection, patients will progress to a range of
symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea or even death. Early detection of disease and
predicting patient outcome helps guide treatment and resource allocation.
However, there is no clear definition of the COVID-19 stage, and a few studies
have talked about the continuation of COVID-19, which makes the need for this
study apparent.

We developed an in-depth short-term learning method, based on a long-term
conscious memory network (T-LSTM) and used an open online database, which
included blood samples of 485 patients from Wuhan, China, for model training.
Our approach can capture volatile relationships in a timely series of rare
samples, which are ignored by existing tasks. Specifically, our approach
predicted the effect of COVID-19 patients by considering both biomarkers and
irregular time intervals. Then, we used patient presentations, extracted from T-
LSTM units, to briefly type patient sections and explain the progression of
COVID-19 disease.
